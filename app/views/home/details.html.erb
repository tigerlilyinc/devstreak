<h3>Program Details</h3>


<dl>
  <dt>General</dt>
  <dd>devStreak is a 6-week Ruby on Rails program intended for individuals with little or no technical background. From 9am-5pm each day, you'll be taking a practical approach to learning software development, and learning in our space in downtown San Francisco. Through a combination of instruction, mentoring, and exploration, you'll train up to the level of a good, junior software engineer. The program is extremely pragmatic - while you will learn the basics of computer science theory, the focus is on how to quickly build working applications.</dd>

    <div class="row">
      <p class="span4">Remember, remember, the fifth of November is the program's first day of class. The first three weeks of the program will be instruction and hands-on coding exercises. During the second three weeks, you'll be working in small groups to build a demo application to show off to potential employers. While there won't be much official instruction during this time, we'll kick up the mentoring and focus on any knowledge gaps or areas of particular interest.</p>

  <dt>Community</dt>
  <dd>You know how there's all those stories about people making great lifelong friends at summer camp? Well, you might not find your soulmate at devStreak, but you'll definitely find supportive people that you'll love to work with. The community aspect of the program is extremely important to us - in addition to being proven to enhance learning experiences, it's just great motivation to be working in a supportive environment. Two of the most frequent reasons people fall behind in education (of any sort) is due to a lack of support, or a lack of accountability. Our team and the other students in the devStreak community will be there with you every step of the way to make sure you suceed!</dd>
  <br />
  <dt>Demo Day</dt>
  <dd>The final day of the program is an opportunity to show off your new skills to potential employers. We're bringing in hiring managers from Bay-area companies, big and small, and you'll get to present the application you're been working on for the past three weeks, and it should be impressive enough to score you a sweet job as a developer.</dd>
